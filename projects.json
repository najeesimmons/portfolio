Stage 1: Recreate the basic functionality and visual style of the game using Javascript and basic DOM manupulation. Stage 2: give users the option to change the number of letters in a guess, making the game more challenging. Stage 3: Adding the ability for users to send friends a link to the game where the guess is a word that the sender has chosen determined. ",
